          <h3>Welcome</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Alex and I have recently set out to evolve from being a tech specialist bank manager, to tech specialist software engineer.
            <br>
            I am currently studying full-stack software engineering with <a  href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flatiron School</a>. 
            <br>         
            This is my new website, I am applying what I have learnt thus far, and adding my own take on it. I will be looking to grow the site organically as I progress.
            <br>
            Fortunately I know my client very well, so hopefully they won't be too demanding!

          <p> I will look to fill this out with some of my latest projects in the meantime - I really enjoyed this assignment:</p>
